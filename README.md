# Android-Git-Client

Android application for GitHub. The application uses [Github Developer API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to fetch all the relevant
user information (The API requires CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET for OAuth as explained [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/)).

The following features are available:
* Allows OAuth application login.
* List of all public and private owned/forked Repositories of the user.
* Provides details of each Repository
  * Branches
  * Commits
  * Files/Directories
* Issues assigned, created or closed by the user in the user-owned repositories.
* Gists created by the user.
* Search interface to fetch details about other users.
* Provides Private feeds to keep a track of activities of the `Following` users.
* Following/Unfollowing a user.
* Allowing Users to star/watch/fork a repository.

The following features are yet to be implemented/integrated:
* Allowing Users to edit files in the application.
* Allowing Users to create/close issues.
* Allowing users to create comments on issues.

Will update this list.
